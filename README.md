# Football-Celebrations-Detection-and-Tracking-using-Yolov8

**Project Overview:**


This project develops a sophisticated deep-learning model using the YOLOv8 algorithm to detect and track football players' celebrations in broadcast videos. Focusing on the unique and charismatic celebration styles of players, like Cristiano Ronaldo's iconic "Siu" celebration, our model aims to identify, classify, and track these moments of triumph and emotional expression.

**Key Features:**


High Accuracy Detection & Tracking: Utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm enhanced with the latest object detection and tracking techniques for pinpoint accuracy.
Custom Dataset: Trained on a meticulously annotated custom dataset, capturing the nuances of football celebrations across a variety of players and styles.
Deep Learning Powered: Leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process and analyze video data, providing insights into player behavior and team dynamics.
Sports Analytics Application: Offers new perspectives for sports analytics, from entertainment to professional team and player analysis.


**Dataset Overview:**
Our model is trained on a privately curated dataset, comprising images and labels of football players' celebrations, manually annotated to ensure accuracy. 

The dataset includes:


A collection of images labeled with bounding boxes around celebrating players.
Annotations include class_id, x_center, y_center, width, and height for each celebration instance.


The data is split into 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing, ensuring comprehensive model evaluation.


**Performance Metrics:**


The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through high precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP) scores:

Precision: 0.98
Recall: 0.988
mAP50: 0.99
mAP50-95: 0.819
These metrics underscore the model's robustness and accuracy in detecting and tracking football players' celebrations across various scenarios.

**Applications:**


This project opens up new avenues for integrating advanced computer vision techniques with sports analytics, providing tools for:


Enhanced viewer experiences during broadcasts.
Detailed player behavior and emotion analysis for teams.
Research and development in automated sports analytics technologies.
Usage & Contribution
This project is ideal for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts interested in computer vision, sports analytics, and machine learning. Contributions to enhance the model, extend the dataset, or improve the application are welcome.
